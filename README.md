Some helphul features, in my opinion. Some of directions :

- Some hotkeys for the scene and project hierarchy
- Some functions for working with materials in the scene
- Working with pivot, mash, and settings that are on the gameobject
- âœ¨ Loading plugins that I personally often use
- Well and a couple of functions that did not go into any department or settings
